Netflix Clone Main Page (No Videos or Interactions)
Overview
This project is a basic Netflix clone that focuses on replicating the main page layout. While it won’t include actual videos or interactive features, it will give you a foundation to build upon.

Features
Header Section:
Display the Netflix logo.
Include navigation links (e.g., Home, TV Shows, Movies, My List).
Banner Section:
Show a large banner image (similar to Netflix’s featured content).
Add a brief description or call-to-action.
Movie/Show Thumbnails:
Create a grid of movie/show thumbnails.
Each thumbnail should have a title and a poster image.
Footer Section:
Include footer links (e.g., About Us, Contact, Terms of Use).
Getting Started
Create a New React App:
Set up a new React project using create-react-app or your preferred method.
Component Structure:
Organize your components (Header, Banner, MovieGrid, Footer, etc.).
Use functional components or class components as needed.
Styling:
Apply basic styling using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library (e.g., styled-components).
Focus on layout, fonts, and colors.
Static Data:
For simplicity, use static data (e.g., an array of movie/show objects) instead of fetching real data from an API.
