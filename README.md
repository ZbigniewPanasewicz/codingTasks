# codingTasks: A Collection of My Coding Projects

This repository serves as a showcase and learning archive for my various coding projects. I'm passionate about web development and exploring different technologies to create engaging and interactive applications.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is organized by programming language or technology, making it easier to find specific types of projects:

- **HTML:** Foundational web page structures and markup.
- **CSS:** Styling and visual design of web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
- **PHP:** Server-side scripting for building web applications.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Other:** I'll be adding projects using other technologies as I learn and experiment.

## How to Explore

1. **Browse by Language:** Navigate to the folder corresponding to the language or technology you're interested in.
2. **Check the README:** Each project folder typically includes a README file with:
   - A description of the project's purpose and functionality.

   - Screenshots or GIFs (if applicable).
   - Any other relevant information or notes.
3. **Try It Out:** Follow the instructions in the README to run the project on your own machine. Feel free to experiment and modify the code!

## Goals
