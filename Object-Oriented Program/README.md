Shoe Inventory Management System
This JavaScript program manages a shoe inventory using constructor functions and various utility functions. It allows you to create shoe objects, search for shoes by product code, find the lowest and highest value per item, edit shoe properties, and order shoes by value.

Features
Shoe Objects:
Define a constructor function (Shoes) to create shoe objects with properties (Name, ProductCode, Quantity, ValuePerItem).
Create five sample shoe objects.
Search by Product Code:
Implement a function (findShoeByProductCode) to search for a shoe by its product code.
Example: Search for a shoe with product code “nike.”
Find Lowest and Highest Value:
Functions (findLowestValue and findHighestValue) identify the shoe with the lowest and highest value per item, respectively.
Display the results.
Edit Shoe Properties:
Modify shoe properties using the editShoe function.
Example: Update properties of shoe1.
Order Shoes by Value:
Sort shoes in ascending order by value per item using the orderByValuePerItem function.
Display the ordered list.
